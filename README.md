# HamAlert app

This is the source code for the HamAlert app, available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hamalert.app) and the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hamalert/id1200759798?mt=8). Its main purpose is to receive push notifications (via FCM and APNS) from the HamAlert backend and display them to the user.

The app is built with Apache Cordova for cross-platform compatibility, and uses [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io) for a native-like feel adapted to the two platforms.
